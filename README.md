# Fully C++ OG MW2 Gameplay Assistance Utility

Demonstrates Reading and Writing to memory of specific process (MW2 Game) using pointers.

# Functions:
Infinite Ammo for Primary and Side Weapons\
Infinite Fire-Rate

# Additional note + warning:
This game is 16+ years old, this code is nothing revolutionary i.e. I am not releasing anything new or malicious, nothing that is not allready out there.  This project was meant as a proof of work, not for malicious intent.  It does not work in multiplayer lobbies, as far as I know.  Again, please do not use this for malicious purposes, it is not intended for that use.
